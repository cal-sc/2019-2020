# Update 61 Notes
<span style="color:blue"> Cardio vascular problems, Nearly 1 million cases, Canada doing better than US, Australia doing really well,
Causes clots, d-dimer increases up to 20, Ace 2 is the enzyme and it gets attacked, UFH helps with reducing coagulation,
Binds to Ace 2, Ace inhibitors are effective, Ace 2 decreased expression of p22phox, Ace 2 causes inflammation and oxidawtive stress when uncontrolled,
Oxidative stress is causing substantial amount of deaths. </span>

# Update 62 Notes
## Pepcid
<span style="color:blue"> Not conclusive because confidence interval not high enough, Repurposing drugs for Covid 19, Fits into enzyme,
Many drugs fit in the enzyme, Dose of pepcid is 9x used in study and injected intravenously, Affects feet  </span>

# Update 63 Notes
<span style="color:blue"> Artery endothelial cells get inflamed, Ventilators aren't as effective, OH hydroxy radical causes oxidative stress,
Rips off electrons, Electrons go from NADPH to reduced form of glutathione, Oxidative stress is main issue, ROS - Reactive Oxygen Species,
Ace 2 - down regulated therefore can't suppress ROS, A779 is helpful </span>

# Update 65 Notes
<span style="color:blue"> H202 gets reduced to H20 by GSHPX, Antioxidant systems can be overrun, 02 ->Superoxide via NADPH oxidase -> H202,
AT-II goes to AT-1,7 via Ace 2, Covid shuts down Ace 2, Recent papers back up these claims, papers written within the last 20 years,
Pregnant women can have an increased sensitivity to angiotensin II, COPD not as high of a risk as being overweight,
Oxidative stress leads to thrombosis  </span>

# Update 67 Notes
<span style="color:blue"> Loss of Ace II increases promotion of superoxide because it does not regulate AT-II, Sars-2 increases endothelial
dysfunction, ECD linked to thrombosis, Increase of oxidative stress increases ECD, Increased risk of antherthrombosis,
Massive increase of vWF coagulation factor, Points to massive endothelial stimulation and damage, Zinc is used to counteract superoxide
damage, Severe inflammatory response syndrome type II diabetes, not type 1?, vWF is a surrogate marker of endothelial dysfunction,
Initiates clot formation at sites of vascular damage, ABO 34 to 26% of hospitalized, 25% of death, ABO have lower levels of vWF, 
lower levels of vWF in caucasians </span>
